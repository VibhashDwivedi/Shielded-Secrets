"Shielded Secrets" is a project that addresses the challenge of secure communication in the digital age by combining steganography and cryptography to protect sensitive information. The growing prevalence of digital data exchange and potential privacy breaches highlight the need for advanced methods of hiding and encrypting confidential messages. This project aims to provide a robust platform that enables users to hide secret messages within media files such as images, audio, and video, while using cryptographic techniques to encrypt the data and secure it from unauthorized access.
